This is a simple program that does two things:

	1) Shows you how to use tinyxml to parse XML.  In this case, it reads the
	   included obstacle definition file (testSceneFile.xml in segmentDist\segmentDist\Exe) and prints summary information about
	   what it found.
	2) Provide a function which computes the minimum distance between two
	   line segments. You may use these functions for CLEAR and LINK queries.
	   
It can be built and run in windows or linux.


Windows instructions:
----------------------------------------------

The project natively builds with MS Visual Studio 2015.  
Simply open the solution and build it.  To run it in the development
environment, you will need to set the "working directory" to: $(OutDir).
